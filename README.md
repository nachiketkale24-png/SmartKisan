## 📱 Overview

**SmartKisan** is a mobile-first agricultural application designed specifically for Indian farmers. It leverages voice commands in Hindi/Hinglish, real-time market data, and AI-powered recommendations to help farmers make informed decisions about crop management, irrigation, disease detection, and government schemes.

The app bridges the digital divide by making advanced agricultural technology accessible to farmers with limited technical expertise through intuitive voice interfaces and bilingual support.

## 🎙️ Voice Command System

### How It Works

```
User Voice Input
       ↓
Audio Recording (expo-av)
       ↓
Speech Recognition
       ↓
Intent Router Analysis
       ↓
Intent Matching with Confidence Score
       ↓
Action Execution / Navigation
       ↓
Text-to-Speech Response (expo-speech)
```

### Supported Intents

| Intent | Commands | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **SHOW_SCHEMES** | scheme, yojana, government | Navigate to Schemes screen |
| **SHOW_PRICES** | bhav, mandi, price, rate | Navigate to Market Prices |
| **CROP_PRICE** | [crop] ka bhav | Show specific crop price |
| **SHOW_IRRIGATION** | sinchai, irrigation, water | Navigate to Irrigation |
| **SHOW_HEALTH** | health, disease, rog | Navigate to Health screen |
| **SHOW_DASHBOARD** | home, dashboard | Return to Dashboard |
| **SHOW_ALERTS** | alert, notification | Navigate to Alerts |
| **CHECK_ELIGIBILITY** | eligible, scheme ke liye | Check scheme eligibility |

### Intent Recognition Logic

```typescript
// 1. Normalize input (lowercase, remove accents)
const normalized = normalizeText(userInput);

// 2. Check against intent patterns
for (const [intent, patterns] of Object.entries(intentPatterns)) {
  if (patterns.some(p => normalized.includes(p))) {
    // Match found
  }
}

// 3. Extract parameters (crop names, etc.)
const params = extractParameters(intent, normalized);

// 4. Calculate confidence score
const confidence = calculateConfidence(match, normalized);

// 5. Execute action with parameters
executeIntent(intent, params);
```

## 📊 Market Prices (Mandi Bhav)

### Data Structure
```typescript
{
  "prices": [
    {
      "crop": "Wheat",
      "cropHindi": "गेहूं",
      "mandis": [
        {
          "name": "Jalandhar Mandi",
          "price": 2200,
          "trend": "up",
          "change": 2.5
        },
        {
          "name": "Chandigarh Mandi",
          "price": 2150,
          "trend": "stable",
          "change": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Features
- **Caching** - Data cached locally with AsyncStorage for offline access
- **Best Mandi Selection** - Algorithm finds highest price for maximum farmer income
- **Trend Analysis** - Shows price movement direction
- **Refresh Logic** - Fetches latest data when online, uses cache when offline

---

## 🏛️ Government Schemes

### Eligibility Checking Algorithm

```
For each scheme:
  1. Check land size → Within limits?
  2. Check state → Available in farmer's state?
  3. Check category → Farmer qualifies by category?
  4. Check documents → Has Aadhaar? Bank account?
  5. Check other criteria
  
  Result:
    ✅ All criteria met → ELIGIBLE
    ❌ Missing requirements → NOT ELIGIBLE (show missing items)
    ⚠️ Some criteria met → PARTIALLY ELIGIBLE (show progress)
```

### Scheme Categories
- **PM Kisan** - Direct income support
- **Crop Insurance** - Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana
- **Irrigation** - Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana
- **Fertilizer Subsidy** - Soil health & nutrients
- **Seed Programs** - Quality seed distribution
- **Training Programs** - Skill development

---

## 💧 Irrigation Recommendations

### Water Calculation Formula
```
Recommended Water = 
  Base Amount × (Soil Moisture Factor) × (Crop Type Factor) × (Season Factor)

Water Savings % = 
  (Standard Water - Recommended Water) / Standard Water × 100

Cost Saved = Water Savings % × Water Bill Rate
```

### Crop-Specific Multipliers
```
Wheat: 0.8x (Lower water requirement)
Rice: 1.5x (Higher water requirement)
Cotton: 1.2x (Moderate-high water requirement)
Sugarcane: 1.4x (High water requirement)
```

## 🌾 Crop Health System

### Health Status Levels

| Status | Color | Meaning | Action |
|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Good** | 🟢 Green | Crop thriving | Continue current care |
| **Warning** | 🟡 Orange | Minor issues | Increase monitoring |
| **Critical** | 🔴 Red | Serious problems | Immediate intervention needed |

### Disease Detection Workflow
1. **Scan** - Take photo of affected crop area
2. **Analyze** - AI identifies potential diseases
3. **Diagnose** - Confirms disease with confidence score
4. **Recommend** - Provides treatment options
5. **Track** - Monitors recovery progress

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Check Government Schemes
```
User: "क्या मैं सरकारी योजना के लिए पात्र हूं?"
App: Records voice → Detects intent "CHECK_ELIGIBILITY"
    → Loads farmer profile → Checks all schemes
    → Displays eligible schemes with benefits
```

### Example 2: Get Market Price Advice
```
User: "गेहूं का भाव क्या है?"
App: Records voice → Detects "CROP_PRICE" intent
    → Extracts crop "Wheat" → Fetches mandi prices
    → Speaks: "गेहूं की सर्वोत्तम कीमत जालंधर मंडी में ₹2,200 है"
    → Shows all mandis with prices
```

### Example 3: Get Irrigation Advice
```
User: "मेरी गेहूं को कितना पानी चाहिए?"
App: Records voice → Detects "SHOW_IRRIGATION" intent
    → Gets current crop data → Calculates water needs
    → Shows: "मिट्टी की नमी देखते हुए 5,000 लीटर पानी दें"
    → Highlights water savings (30% vs standard)
```
